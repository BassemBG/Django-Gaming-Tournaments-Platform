# Django-Gaming-Tournaments-Platform

An academic Project implemented in collaboration with 5 other students in order to understand the scrum methodology and explore Django as a framework.

Before running the project, please run the following command to install all the libraries/dependencies necessary for the project to work properly:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Everytime you install/add a new dependency or library, please add it to the requirements.txt file so we just need to run the command above in case of missing libraries

IMPORTANT NOTE!!! 
removed the stats package from setting.py due to package issues.
