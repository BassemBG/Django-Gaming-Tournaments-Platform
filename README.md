# Django-Gaming-Tournaments-Platform

An academic Project implemented in collaboration with 5 other students in order to understand the scrum methodology and explore Django as a framework.

Before running the project, please run the following command to install all the libraries/dependencies necessary for the project to work properly:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Everytime you install/add a new dependency or library, please add it to the requirements.txt file so we just need to run the command above in case of missing libraries
